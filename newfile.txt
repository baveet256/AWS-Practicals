## notes:

Jmes path to query in aws s3api, list buckets

aws s3 sync is basically a two-way file replication tool for S3, but most people use it in one direction at a time.
aws s3 sync ./local-folder s3://my-bucket/



$0 - name of the script, that is being executed
$1 - first argument and so on

$# is the number of arguments passed to the script.

-ne 1 means “not equal to 1”.


jq is a library used to sort json


 echo "This is file number $i" > "$directory/$filename"  ---> overwrite the content to the file
echo "Random data: $random_data" >> "$directory/$filename" ---> appends the content of random_data to the file specified


Key → The full “path” (string) where the object will be stored in the bucket, e.g., "folder/subfolder/file.txt".

Body → The actual content of the file/object you’re uploading.
